Counting Bigrams: Testing Plan

List your test cases below. The first test case is provided so you have an example to work from. Every test should include a short name for the test, a description of what the test case covers, the input you will provide to the program, and the expected output. If your test case focuses on just part of the output you are welcome to abbreviate the expected output (note any omitted parts of the input with "..."). Please leave a blank line between test cases so they are visually separated.

Tests:

1. Short lowercase input
This test checks to make sure the program handles a short input containing only lowercase letters.
Input: "abc"
Expected Output:
"ab": 1
"bc": 1
Most common bigram: "ab"

2. Long mixed-case input
This test checks how well the program handles a longer input containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
Input: "HelloWorld"
Expected Output:
"He": 1
"el": 1
"ll": 1
"lo": 1
"oW": 1
"Wo": 1
"or": 1
"rl": 1
"ld": 1
Most common bigram: "He"

3. Short uppercase input with repeated characters

This test checks if the program handles a short input containing only uppercase letters with repeated characters.
Input: "ABA"
Expected Output:
"AB": 1
"BA": 1
Most common bigram: "AB"

4. Empty input

This test verifies that the program handles an empty input correctly.
Input: ""
Expected Output:
The input did not contain any bigrams.

5. Input with digits

This test checks if the program handles input containing digits correctly.
Input: "12345"
Expected Output:
"12": 1
"23": 1
"34": 1
"45": 1
Most common bigram: "12"


6. All symbols

This test verifies that the program handles an input with all symbols.
Input: "@!@$@"
Expected Output:
"!@": 1
"$@": 1
"@!": 1
"@$": 1

Most common bigram: "!@"

7. Input with mixed case and special characters

This test verifies that the program correctly handles input with a combination of uppercase, lowercase letters, and special characters.
Input: "Th1s Is A T3st!"
Expected Output:
"Th": 1
"h1": 1
"1s": 1
"s ": 2
" I": 1
"Is": 1
" A": 1
"A ": 1
" T": 1
"T3": 1
"3s": 1
"st": 1
Most common bigram: "s "
